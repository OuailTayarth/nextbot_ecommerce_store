# NextBot: Discover AI-powered robotics that fit your lifestyle.
NextBot is a full-stack e-commerce app for buying robotics products (humanoids and robot dogs).   
I built it as a deep dive learning project to master Supabase database, GraphQL and full-stack application development. It uses the Next.js App Router, GraphQL for data fetching, Supabase for PostgresSQL + RLS, Drizzle for schema/seeding, Tailwind + shadcn/ui for the UI, and AWS S3 for media uploads.
