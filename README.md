# NextBot: Discover AI-powered robotics that fit your lifestyle.
NextBot is a full-stack e-commerce app for buying robotics products (humanoids and robot dogs).   

I built it as a deep-dive learning project to strengthen my skills with Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS), GraphQL, and in designing a scalable end-to-end web application. It uses the Next.js App Router, GraphQL for data fetching, Supabase for PostgreSQL + RLS, Drizzle for schema/migrations and seeding, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui for the UI, and AWS S3 for media uploads.
